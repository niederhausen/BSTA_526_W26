Thanks!\n\nI promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail us, etc.\n\n\n\nAlison Horst Jan 3, 2020 tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Horst: Gator error"

However, the work you turn in must be your own. Thus it is inappropriate to directly ask AI to provide you with solutions to homework questions or write text that you are submitting in your assignment.\nIf you do use AI tools to help you with an assignment, these must be cited along with how they were used.\nPlease see the Plagiarism & Attribution section (Code Snippets and AI Tools subsection) of Dr. Steve Bedrick’s BMI 525: Principles and Practice of DataVisualization webpage for examples of appropriate and inappropriate uses generative AI."
