## Readings


### Required

#### `ggplot2`

-   R4DS book
    -   [Chapter 1](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html): Data visualization intro
    -   [Sections 9.1-9.3](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers.html#introduction): Aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, facets
    -   [Section 11.5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communication.html#sec-themes): ggplot themes


#### `dplyr`

-   R4DS book sections 3.1-3.3 (skip 3.3.1, which will be covered in part 4), 12.3
-   [`dplyr` cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html) - one of the best references.
-   [Combining functions using the pipe operator, |> which is mostly equivalent to %>%](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/wrangling.html#combining-functions-using-the-pipe-operator); if you're confused about `|>` or `%>%`, please read this.


### Optional 

#### `ggplot2` 

If you are interested in learning more about ggplot:

- [ggplot2 BERD workshop slides](https://sph-r-programming.netlify.app/ggplot_flipbookr_berd/04_ggplot_slides.html) - lots more on different `geoms` and how to customize plots
- [Themes to improve your ggplot figures](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures/) by David Keyes is really helpful for learning how to do more styling. 
- RStudio also publishes a [ggplot cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) that is really handy!
- [Customizing ggplot2 Cheatsheet](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) is also handy, because it organizes ggplot2 commands by task.
- Documentation for all `ggplot` features is available [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).
-   [New `ggplot` options](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/09/ggplot2-4-0-0/) with the latest version 4 released in September 2025

#### `janitor` package

Take a look at the [`janitor` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) to learn more about functions include in the `janitor` package

Below are `janitor` functions being covered in part 3:

-   [`clean_names()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#clean-dataframe-names-with-clean_names)
-   [`remove_empty()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#remove_empty-rows-and-columns)
-   [`tabyl()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#tabyl---a-better-version-of-table)
