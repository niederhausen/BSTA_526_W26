I'm going to highlight another resource for learning R concepts: swirl. This is a software package for R.

To start it, run the following code in the console:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(swirl)
swirl()
```

You'll want to take a look at the `R Programming` course, especially the following sections:

1. Basic Building Blocks
3. Sequences of Numbers
4. Vectors
5. Missing values
